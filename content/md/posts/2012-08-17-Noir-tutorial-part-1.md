### Background

Clojure web stack consists of [Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring), which is the base HTTP library akin to Python's WSGI and Ruby's Rack. On top of Ring lives [Compojure](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure), which provides some basic routing, and that in turn is leveraged by [Noir](http://www.webnoir.org/) to provide a simple framework for developing websites. Here's we'll see how to use Noir to build a basic website. 

### Setting Up a Noir Project With Leiningen

The easiest way to get Noir setup is to use [Leiningen 2](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/), which has become the de facto build tool for Clojure. Once you have Leiningen installed, you can simply do the following to get a template site created:
```bash
lein new noir my-website
cd my-website
```
Alternatively, if you're using [Counterclockwise](http://code.google.com/p/counterclockwise/) with Eclipse, then all you need to do is make a new Leiningen project and put `noir` in the `"Leiningen Template to use:"` field.

#### Project Structure

The template site will have the following structure:
```bash
/my-website
  project.clj
  --src/
     --my_website/
       server.clj
       --models/
       --views/common.clj
               welcome.clj
  --test/my_website
  --resources/public/
                  --css/reset.css
                  --img/
                  --js/
```
The skeleton application contains a few files in it. The `project.clj` file is used for building the application and managing dependencies by Leiningen. Under the `src` folder, we  have the folder called `my_website` which contains `server.clj`. This file contains the entry point to our application. It loads up all the views and provides a main function which can be used to start the application.

The `models` folder is used to keep the data layer of the application, such as code for the database access and table management. The `views` folder contains the namespaces describing the pages of our application and their supporting code. The template contains `common.clj` which provides a basic layout and any code shared between the pages. The `welcome.clj` is the namespace where an example page is defined.

### Dependency Management

Let's first look at the `project.clj` file:
```clojure
(defproject my-site "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
            :description "FIXME: write this!"
            :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.4.0"]
                           [noir "1.3.0-beta3"]]
            :main my-site.server)
```
The file is fairly self explanatory, and currently only contains dependencies for Clojure and Noir.

#### Running the Project in Development Mode

At this point we should be able to start up our website:
```bash
lein run

Starting server...
2012-08-16 09:39:22.479:INFO::Logging to STDERR via org.mortbay.log.StdErrLog
Server started on port [8080].
You can view the site at http://localhost:8080
#<Server Server@2206270b>
2012-08-16 09:39:22.480:INFO::jetty-6.1.25
2012-08-16 09:39:22.521:INFO::Started SocketConnector@0.0.0.0:8080
```
Let's point the browser to [`localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) and  make sure everything is working as expected. We should be greeted with a Noir help page since we haven't defined one for "/" route yet. At this point we can start editing our pages and any changes we make should be reflected immediately.

###Creating Pages

Noir provides two primary way to manipulate pages. One useful macro is `defpartial` which simply wraps the body in `html` function from Hiccup, which will generate the resulting HTML string from our content:
```clojure
(defpartial foo [content]
  [:p content])

(foo "some stuff")
"<p>some stuff</p>"
```
The other is `defpage`, this macro will create a Compojure route for the specified URL. It has the following syntax:
```clojure
(defpage url params content)
```
By default `defpage` is expected to return an HTML string. How that string is generated is up to you. In this tutorial we'll be using Hiccup, but you could just as easily use something like [Enlive](http://paulosuzart.github.com/blog/2012/03/25/web-noir-plus-enlive-template/) to create your templates using actual HTML. Noir itself is completely agnostic in this regard. 

Now, let's look at the parameters that `defpage` accepts. First we have a URL which supports the following formats:
* a simple string such as `"/welcome"`
* a RESTful path such as `"/welcome/:user"` where the key `:user` will be appended to the params map with the value provided when the URL is accessed
* a vector specifying the request type which the page responds too : `[:post "/welcome"]`

Next, we have params, which is simply a map of keywords and their associated values generated from the request parameters. Any keys from the URL will also appear in this map:
```clojure
(defpage "/welcome/:user" {:keys [user]}
  (html [:html [:body "hello " user]]))
```
Finally, we add the actual page content to be rendered. As I mentioned above the result **must** be a string, so generally we'll wrap the contents of each page in `(common/layout ...)` which was provided by the template. The official documentation for `defpage` with lots of other examples and details is available [here](http://www.webnoir.org/tutorials/routes).

#### Handling Form Input

When making pages with forms the general pattern is to create a `defpage` for the GET request which will contain the UI, and another for POST which contains the server component. To test that out, let's change `welcome.clj` to look like the following:
```clojure
(ns my-website.views.welcome
  (:require [my-website.views.common :as common]
            [noir.content.getting-started])
  (:use [noir.core :only [defpage]]
        hiccup.core hiccup.form))

(defpage "/welcome" {:keys [greeting]}
  (common/layout
    (if greeting [:h2 greeting])
    (form-to [:post "/welcome"]
      (label "name" "name")
      (text-field "name")
      (submit-button "submit"))))

(defpage [:post "/welcome"] {:keys [name]}
  (noir.core/render "/welcome" 
    {:greeting (str "Welcome " name)}))
```
As can be seen above, the page which responds to GET creates a form and submits it to its POST counterpart. It in turn generates a greeting and renders the page with it. Note that the names for fields used in the form get translated into keys in the params map when we submit it.

before submit

and after submit

This covers the basic model for creating pages and interacting with them. Now, let's look at how we can package our website into a standalone application. 

### Packaging and Running Standalone

To package our project we need to change our server to compile into a class, we can do this by simply adding `gen-class` to its namespace like so:
```clojure
(ns my-website.server
  (:require [noir.server :as server]) 
  (:gen-class))
```
Now we can build and run our project:
```bash
lein uberjar
java -jar my-website-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar

Starting server...
2012-08-16 20:12:47.846:INFO::Logging to STDERR via org.mortbay.log.StdErrLog
2012-08-16 20:12:47.846:INFO::jetty-6.1.x
2012-08-16 20:12:47.882:INFO::Started SocketConnector@0.0.0.0:8080
Server started on port [8080].
You can view the site at http://localhost:8080
```
