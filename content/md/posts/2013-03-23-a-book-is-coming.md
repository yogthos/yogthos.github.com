{:title "a book is coming", :layout :post, :tags []}

First of all, I'd like to thank all those who've helped with Luminus. Since the original release on Clojars at the end of December there's been over [700 downloads](https://clojars.org/luminus/lein-template), and the framework site has over 3,500 unique visits!

There's also been many contributions for improved documentation, template fixes, and lib-noir improvements. I'm really thankful for all the help improving the framework and moving it forward. I'd especially like to thank [Ed Tsech](http://about.me/edtsech), who's been toiling on it with me for the last few months. :)

I'm really glad to be able to contribute to popularizing the language and making it more accessible. On that note I have some exciting news. I've recently got signed by the [The Pragmatic Programmers](http://pragprog.com/) to write a book on web development using Clojure.

There is a number of books discussing the fundamentals of Clojure as a language. However, none of the books focus on applying these fundamentals to building real-world solutions. Respondents of the [2012 State of Clojure survey](http://cemerick.com/2012/07/19/2012-state-of-clojure-survey/) indicated that there still exists a gap in traditional documentation. Specifically, an interest in current tools, libraries, and best practices is not being met. It is my goal to help fill this gap.

I will provide an overview of Clojure as a web development platform, highlighting exactly what makes it so effective. The book will take a tutorial-focused approach to building a production-ready web application from conception to deployment.

The target audience is anyone interested in using Clojure as a web development platform. This includes: those who are currently using the JVM for development; Ruby and Python users who would like to take advantage of the breadth of features and libraries offered by the JVM; and readers simply interested in learning how to develop web applications using Clojure.

I'm quite thrilled about this project and I hope to write the book I wish I had when I spent countless hours googling for tutorials and examples. :)
