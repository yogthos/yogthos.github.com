{:title "Yet Another Clojure Intro Guide",
 :layout :post,
 :tags ["clojure"]}

There are already lots of guides introducing Clojure syntax and many of its features, but these guides tend to focus on individual examples as opposed to the broad concepts behind the language.

In my experience, the difficulty in learning Clojure doesn't stem from the syntax, but from having to approach problems with a new mindset. The goal of this guide is to impart such a mindset on the reader. How badly I fail at this task remains to be seen. :P

Without further ado, [here's](http://yogthos.github.io/ClojureDistilled.html) the guide itself, and I hope you'll find it useful if you're starting out with Clojure.
