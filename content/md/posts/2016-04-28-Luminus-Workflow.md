{:title "Luminus Workflow", :layout :post, :tags ["luminus"]}

I recently presented at the [Philly ETE conference](http://2016.phillyemergingtech.com/), and it was a really great experience.
The conference was well organized, there were lots of great talks, and I got to meet a bunch of interesting people.

My [talk](http://chariotsolutions.com/screencast/philly-ete-2016-2-dmitri-sotnikov-transforming-enterprise-development-clojure/)
focused on the workflow using Luminus and Reagent. During the talk I built a simple app from scratch. The app illustrates how to
work with a relational database, create a documented service API, and build a UI for it using Reagent. The live demo portion stats
around the 11 minute mark.

If you're interested in my workflow using Luminus and Cursive, then I definitely recommend watching the talk.
