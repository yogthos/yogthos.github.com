I'm glad to announce that the [second edition of Web Development with Clojure](https://pragprog.com/book/dswdcloj2/web-development-with-clojure-second-edition) is finally finished. The book took longer to put together than I anticipated, and I ended up missing the original release target by a few months.

However, all the delays resulted in a much better book in the end. Having a long beta period allowed me to collect a lot of feedback from the readers and address any concerns that came up. This process helped ensure that the material is clear and easy to follow, while keeping a good pace. I discussed the specifics of what the book covers an earlier post [here](http://yogthos.net/posts/2016-01-01-ClojureWebDev2.html).



It's my sincere hope that the book will provide the readers with a smooth path into the wonderful world of Clojure web development.
