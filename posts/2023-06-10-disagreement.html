    <p>Throughout my career, I have come to appreciate the vital role of open debate in the successful execution of projects. Curiously, arguments and disagreements often carry negative connotations, yet they serve as indispensable tools for fostering a shared comprehension of the problems at hand.</p><p>Individuals frequently shy away from engaging in arguments due to personal insecurities that hinder the expression of contrary opinions. Moreover, the fear of causing offense through disagreement serves as a deterrent, preventing many from sharing crucial insights with their teams. When these valuable insights remain private, teams are susceptible to investing significant time and effort in constructing solutions that are fundamentally flawed.</p><p>Open debate, encompassing the nature of the problem being addressed and the proposed solutions, stands as a pivotal factor in establishing a well-functioning team. It is crucial to recognize that disagreements generally arise from individuals approaching the problem from different perspectives. One developer may ponder a specific set of trade-offs, while another contemplates a different set.</p><p>Each developer possesses only a partial view of the overall picture, rendering the solution proposed by the other developer seemingly incorrect from their respective vantage points. The path to comprehending the complete picture involves engaging in dialogue to grasp the trade-offs considered by each person. Once this pivotal step is taken, it becomes possible to arrive at a solution that addresses the concerns of all involved.</p><p>The ultimate objective is not necessarily to discover the optimal solution, but rather to consciously select a set of trade-offs that everyone finds agreeable. By doing so, we ensure that all team members possess a shared understanding of the problem at hand and the rationale behind adopting a specific approach to tackle it.</p><p>It is vital to recognize that the ability to engage in frank discussions is a gradual process. Engaging in activities such as pair programming, where developers collaborate closely and solve problems together, can facilitate the development of comfort and familiarity. As individuals grow more acquainted with one another, the prospect of openly disagreeing becomes more natural and effortless.</p><p>Finally, I highly recommend watching a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTtnx1AAJ-c'>recent talk</a> from Rich Hickey discussing this in more detail.</p>
